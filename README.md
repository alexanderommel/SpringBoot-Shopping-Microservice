## How it works

This service provides a set of endpoints to be accessed from a web page or mobile client such as Tongue Customers App, some of the endpoints that you might call are GET : shopping/storevariants to obtain a JSON array of available stores, GET: /shipping/collections?storeVariantId can be used to get the list of available collections of products provided by the merchant of the stor and so on.
